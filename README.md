# World Cup Database

*This project consists of creating a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then querying the database for useful statistics.*

## Problem Statement

You start with several files, one of them is *games.csv* . It contains a comma-separated list of all games of the final three rounds of the World Cup tournament since 2014; the titles are at the top. It includes the year of each game, the round of the game, the winner, their opponent, and the number of goals each team scored. 

You need to do three things for this project:

- Part 1: Create the database 

  Create your database structure according to the user stories below. Don't forget to connect to the database after you create it. 

- Part 2: Insert the data 

  Complete the *insert_data.sh* script to correctly insert all the data from *games.csv* into the database. 

- Part 3: Query the database 

  Complete the empty echo commands in the *queries.sh* file to produce output that matches the *expected_output.txt* file.
